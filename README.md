# spellcrypt

   Under construction, no usable content ... encryption done, stage one

     An encryption algorythm that turns this:

        The greatest Enemy of Knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
        knowledge.

     Into this:

        Nonagon waxy Unimplemented whitecap Clinically dionysos bussey nootka,
            constitutionals colb kirkwood befitting whitecap clinically.


  How it works:

    A dictionary is indexed into the original file, and the indexes are
      'encrypted' The new index is untangeld from the dictionary, which yields a
    differebt text. The decryption does the reverse.


    Strength: strong enough to withstand and but the most resource intesive attacks.
    The varible strenght is also a fundtion of the password quality.
